echo Running all tests
echo =================
echo Bear in mind that this includes the Ansible integration tests which
echo take more time than all the other tests combined. They also require certain
echo ssh configurations to be in place to ensure proper operation. Besides having
echo ssh installed, the user running the tests must be able to ssh login to the
echo local host without a password. Additionally, to test logging in as a different
echo user, a user 'lxle1' must exist as this is the user the tests attempt to
echo log in as. A public and private keypair for this user is part of Actuator's
echo source, and you need to install the public key into appropriate place in the
echo lxle1 user's .ssh directory so that passwordless logins can be conducted for
echo this user. Failure to do this right will result in some of the Ansible
echo integration tests failing.
echo
echo NOTE: test017 is currently failing due to the apparent misbehavior of
echo sshpass trying to provide the password to ssh \(a BROKEN PIPE error is
echo received instead of the password going along properly\). This will be
echo studied more in the future, but the workaround is to instead provide a
echo private_key_file for the tasks you want to run as another user.
